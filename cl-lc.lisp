(defcomp list-of collect
  "A list comprehension.

A list comprehension consists of an expression, whose results will be
collected, followed by a list of filters and generators.

Generators are expressions with a keyword as their second argument.
     (list-of x (for x in xs))
     ≡ (mapcar #'identity xs)

The binding of a generator can use destructuring:

     (list-of key ((key . value) :in alist))

Generators can be made parallel simply by enclosing them in a list.

    (list-of (list x y)
      ((for x in xs) (for y in ys)))
    ≡ (list-of (list x y)
       (for (x y) in (mapcar #'list xs ys)))

Filters are ordinary expressions that filter the results of each
generator:

     (list-of x (for x in (iota 10)) (evenp x))
     => (2, 4, 6, 8, 10)

You may use `if', `when', and `unless' as syntactic sugar:

     (list-of x (for x in (iota 10)) if (evenp x))
     => (2 4 6 8 10)

     (list-of x (for x in (iota 10)) unless (evenp x))
     => (1 3 5 7 9)

Generators can be any `for' clause understood by Iterate, including
user-defined ones. We also provide an additional driver, `(for .. over
...)', which allow iterating over any sequence.")
